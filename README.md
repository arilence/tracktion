# tracktion

Tracktion is an experimental coop driving game using the libGDX framework and google play services.

The goal of the game is to keep the vehicle in the world from falling below a certain speed. There are two roles to make this goal achievable:

-   Role #1: Control a vehicle throughout a track. Failure to stay above the threshold will result in a game over.
-   Role #2: Place down track pieces for the vehicle to drive along. If the vehicle is not on top of the track, it will be slowed down significantly until coming to a stop.
