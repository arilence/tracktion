# tracktion

Tracktion is an experimental coop driving game using the libGDX framework.

The goal of the game is different depending on what the player's role is.

-   The first role is to control a vehicle throughout a track without falling below a certain speed. Failure to stay above the threshold will result in a game over.
-   The second role is to place down track pieces for the driver to move along. If the driver is not ontop of the track, the vehicle will be slowed down significantly until it comes to a stop.
