# tracktion

Tracktion is an experimental coop driving game using the libGDX framework. The goal of the game is for one player to control a vehicle throughout a track without falling below a certain speed. The world starts out with two track pieces, and the second players goal is to place addition pieces down. If the driver is not ontop of the track, the vehicle will be slowed down significantly until it comes to a stop. Failure to keep the vehicles speed above the threshold will result in a game over.
